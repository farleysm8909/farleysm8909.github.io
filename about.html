          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I spent the first 18 years of my life in <b>Rochester, Minnesota</b>. As a child, my free time was spent outside playing with my black lab and/or my two older brothers, writing short stories, taking photos, bowling and learning how to cook with my mom. My favorite classes were English <i>and</i> math; I enjoyed both the creative freedom associatied with the former as well as the logical reasoning required in the latter.</p> 
          <p>I moved to <b>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</b>, to earn my undergraduate degree in multimedia and web design. After studying abroad in <b>Valladolid, Spain</b> <span class="printRemove">(<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Valladolid,+Spain/@41.7031684,-4.948896,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd47728c08c66e93:0xb3ff92d41ca26bef!8m2!3d41.652251!4d-4.7245321" target="_blank" class="link">see map &#8599;</a>),</span> in 2018, my dream of using technology to better connect people was realized. Working as a web developer will allow me to create web applications that further link our diverse world while challenging me creatively and logically. At UW-Eau Claire, I tacked on a certificate in computer programming in order to learn more about computers and back-end development.</p>
          <p>Now, I am pursuing a Master's degree in computer science at Boston University to further my knowledge of computers. I believe in the power of education and intend to stay current on technological topics as I continue my job search in a field that is constantly evolving. I currently live in <b>Brighton, Massachusetts</b> where I work remotely as a part-time teacher for a youth coding school. I plan to stay in the <b>Boston, Massachusetts</b> area until further notice.</p>
