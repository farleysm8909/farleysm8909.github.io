WEEK 1 --------------------------------------------

How I went above and beyond
  - Created 5 web pages instead of 3
  - Used 5-7 semantic elements on each page (each page contains a <header>, <nav>, <main> and <footer>, as well as additional tags like <section>, <figure>, <figcaption>, etc.)
  - Embeded 2 videos and over 10 images
  - Used elements such as &amp;, &copy;, &mdash;, <hr>
  - Wrote what I hope is considered interesting content pertaining to me (see About and Index) as opposed to Lorem Ipsum/filler text

WEEK 2 --------------------------------------------

How I went above and beyond
- imported and used Google fonts (h1-h3, print h1-h3)
- used flexbox to layout pages
- added comments to stylesheets to better organize them (I plan to break these sections up so that each html page has its own CSS screen and print stylesheets in addition to the general one)
- Added 2 more pages (replaced gallery.html with photography.html, added videography.html and graphics.html)
- Created a drop-down menu in navigation under Work Samples
- More than 3 changes in printstyle.css:
  1) Hid navigation
  2) Changed body text from a sans-serif (Arial) to a serif font (Times New Roman)
  3) Changed header/h1/h2/h3 font from a sans-serif (Poppins) to a serif font (Domine)
  4) Got rid of text hyperlinks 
    - index.html: "Learn more about me ->"
    - about.html: "see map" and "cold process soapmaking"
  5) Updated footer (got rid of background color, updated color property and font-size)
  6) Made print message/notice visible in footer
  7) Hid resume figure and replaced it with print instructions; I decided that since the iframe offers its own way to print out the document and since the resume is itself a perfect page, it didn't make sense to print it out with the webpage since the header and h1 would push some of the resume down and disrupt its original look). Please let me know if you'd like for me to handle this differently, but this made the most sense to me.
  8) Tweaked other margins as necessary
- Added "fun facts" about me to About.html to add to my site's interesting content
- Spent a lot of time this week trying to get a good start on the term project so I (hopefully) don't have as much work to do towards the end of the semester when I will be much busier with my jobs!

Please note the following:
- This website is by no means finished; e.g., the footer isn't quite at the bottom of the page on videography.html; this will be fixed after I add more content.
- I decided to leave the contact form visible on the print version; I wasn't sure what is best practice here since the entire page revolves around that digital form. Let me know if you'd like me to hide it instead since it obviously isn't much use on a printed page.
